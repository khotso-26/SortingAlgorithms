# Sorting Algorithms
This Python application provides implementations of commonly used sorting algorithms: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, and Bubble Sort. These algorithms can be used to sort a list of elements in ascending or descending order.

## Algorithms Implemented
The following sorting algorithms are implemented in this application:

- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Bubble Sort

## Usage
To use the sorting algorithms, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the `sorting_algorithms.py` file in a Python IDE or editor.
3. Modify the main function to customize the list of elements to be sorted.
4. Choose the desired sorting algorithm by uncommenting the corresponding function call.
5. Run the `sorting_algorithms.py` file.
6. The sorted list will be displayed in the console output.

**Note:** You can modify the list of elements and the sorting algorithm based on your specific requirements.

## Algorithm Details
Merge Sort
Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input list into smaller sublists, sorts them recursively, and then merges them to produce a sorted output. It has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the average and worst case scenarios.

## Quick Sort
Quick Sort is also a divide-and-conquer algorithm that partitions the input list into two sublists based on a chosen pivot element. It recursively sorts the sublists on either side of the pivot. Quick Sort has an average time complexity of O(n log n) but can degrade to O(n^2) in the worst case.

## Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted list one element at a time. It iterates over the input list, comparing each element with the previous ones and placing it in the correct position. Insertion Sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case but performs well for small lists.

## Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order until the entire list is sorted. It has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case. Bubble Sort is straightforward to understand but less efficient compared to other sorting algorithms.
